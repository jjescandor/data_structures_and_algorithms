# Singly Linked List
1. A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).

1. Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

## Challenge
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
1. insert
    Arguments: value
    Returns: nothing

1.  includes
    Arguments: value
    Returns: Boolean

1. to string
    Arguments: none

## Approach & Efficiency
1. We implemented a Big O time complexity of O(n) for the to_string() and includes() methods.
1. We implemented a Big O time complexity of O(1) for the insert() method
1. We implemeted a Big O space complexcity of O(1) for all the methods of the linked list
## API

1. to_string() -> returns a a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
1. insert() -> Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
1. includes() -> Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
